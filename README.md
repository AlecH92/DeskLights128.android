Old patch notes:
V1.4: Fix application closing on cancel from color picker.
V1.3: Updated with new Color Picker ( https://code.google.com/p/color-picker-view ). Replaces the dropdown menu, and the color selected applies to both X,Y coordinates or the Table to Color command
V1.2: Updated to use HTTP GET instead of HTTP POST. This change was made to support a move to WiFi instead of Ethernet Arduinos.
